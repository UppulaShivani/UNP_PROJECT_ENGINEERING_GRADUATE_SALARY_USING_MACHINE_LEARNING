Completed this project as part of my Learning with United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:

Studied and Analyzed the Engineering Graduate Salary dataset to applying ML models and present my insights. Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables. Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbours, and Boosting. Compared the results to recommend the best Machine Learning model.
